# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "Iris" dataset using
 Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, species.
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Dataset Description
The "Iris" dataset contains information about flowers into three categories, setosa, versicolor, virginica. Each entry represents a unique 
dining experience and includes the following columns:


- **sepal_length**: Denotes the length of the sepal (a part of the flower) in centimeters
- **sepal_width**: Indicates the width of the sepal in centimeters.		
- **petal_length**: Specifies the length of the petal (another part of the flower) in centimeters.
- **petal_width**:Represents the width of the petal in centimeters.		.
- **species**:  Classifies the species of iris flowers into three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
